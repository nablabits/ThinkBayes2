    "**Non flawed machine:**\n",
    "For a non-flawed machine we can trust the outcome of what it sees, so the likelihoods are as follows:\n",
    "* $H_l: hs$; fliping heads agrees with the hypothesis space\n",
    "* $T_l: 1-hs$; flipping tails is against the hypothesis space\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full flawed machine**\n",
    "For a full flawed machine is the other way round. This means that when the machine sees a head, it's indeed a tail:\n",
    "* $H_l: 1-hs$; fliping heads is against the hypothesis space (as we actually flipped a tail, not a head)\n",
    "* $T_l: hs$; flipping tails agrees with the hypothesis space\n",

    "**Half-flawed machine**\n",
    "For a half-flawed machine no matter the outcome of the flip, half of the hypothesis space aggrees with the result and the other half disagrees:\n",

    "* $T_l: .5\\cdot hs + .5\\cdot(1-hs)$    \n",

    "This, effectively, bring us back to the starting point where every hypothesis is equally probable. We are substituting the randomness of a coin by the randomness of the machine.\n",

    "**Intermediate flaw levels**\n",
    "For intermediate flaw values we have a mix in both quantities, this is for a 1/5 flaw:\n",
    "* $H_l: .8\\cdot hs + .2\\cdot(1-hs)$\n",
    "* $T_l: .2\\cdot hs + .8\\cdot(1-hs)$\n",

    "**General expression**  \n",
