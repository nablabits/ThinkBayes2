    "**Exercise:** Suppose that in the criminal justice system, all prison sentences are either 1, 2, or 3 years, with an equal number of each.  One day, you visit a prison and choose a prisoner at random.  What is the probability that they are serving a 3-year sentence?  What is the average remaining sentence of the prisoners you observe?"
