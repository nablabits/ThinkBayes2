    "\n",
    "[Probably worth picking up at a later point]\n",
    "\n",
    "I like to think that Poisson and Exponential distributions are both sides of the same coin as in one you have events per time and the other tells you time between events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2092/relationship-between-poisson-and-exponential-distribution I see that $P(\\boldsymbol{X}\\le x)= 1- e^{-\\lambda x}$ that means that the probability of your waiting time being less than a given amount of time $x$ follows the cdf of an exponential distribution. Which is equivalent to say that the probability of the number of events being constant decays exponentially $P(N_{t+x}-N_t=0)=e^{-\\lambda x}$\n",
    "\n",
    "However this is my reasoning:\n",
    "If we have a $\\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda=3)$ this tells us the probability of getting $n$ events when we average 3 events per unit time (say days, from now on). On the other hand $\\mathrm{Exponential}(\\lambda=3)$ will tell us the probability of waiting more than $x$ days when you average the same three events per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above works well when your waiting time is more than 1, that is, you have to wait for more than one day to see an event and therefore your events per day are 0 as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{3^0\\cdot e^{-3}}{0!}=1 - (1-e^{-3\\cdot1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One might argue, though, that if your waiting time is, say, 1.5 you have no events the first day and one the second and here is where the problems come in because that probability does not live in the 0 bar of the Poisson distribution but in the 1 which makes above being false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having 3 events per day, means that your waiting time between events is 1/3. More generally, if your waiting time is:\n",
    "* 1/3 days, then you have the first day 3 events, and the second another 3 events\n",
    "* 1/4 days, then you have the first day 4 events, and the second another 4 events\n",
    "* 11/60 days (in the middle of 1/5 and 1/6), then you have events following this pattern:\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:7a58684e-b7c4-48ae-800e-e8648f481f1a.png)\n",
    "* 2/3 days, then you have the first day one event and two events the second.\n",
    "* 2 days, then the first day you have 0 events and one the second.\n",
    "* 5 days, then you have four days of 0 events and one event on the fifth\n",
    "\n",
    "So far so good.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting more than 3 events/d according a Poisson distribution is:\n",

    "## Flaw in the reasoning: memoryless\n",
    "This seems the flaw of above reasoning: I'm assuming that if you have 1/2 days of waiting time, that matches 1:1 with 2 events per day, which is not true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have 2 events per day there are a bunch of scenarios that produce that result, for instance, 1/3+2/3, 1/4+3/4, and so on. This is possible because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution that says that at any point in your waiting time, no matter how long have you been waiting for, your probability of waiting any $x$ minutes more follows the same exponential model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why 0 matches: because having no events in a day is exactly equal to wait for more than one day for the event, there's a 1:1 relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you have one event per day, that can be produced by the following waiting times: 1/3 + 3/3, 1/2 + 2/3, and, so on. Which is clear is that the first waiting time must be less than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe one of the sources of confusion was that I was naming *time between events* when it's really the time between one event and the next, or because of the memoryless property the time between when you arrive and the next event happening."
